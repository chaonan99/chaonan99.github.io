# Run on localhost
> Just a reminder of how to view these pages on localhost. Yet to generate web page on github page, the following requirements and local check are **not needed**.

## Requirement
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Here is [Ruby installer for windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/).
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Note: command should be executed from ruby environment. Find the command tool under ruby install directory.

## Run server

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

There will be some error if I only run `jekyll serve` and I haven't figured out why.
