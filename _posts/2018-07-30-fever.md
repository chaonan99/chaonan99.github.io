We are happy to announce that our team UNC-NLP ([Yixin Nie](https://easonnie.github.io/), [I](http://chaonan99.github.io/) and [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/)) got the first place in the recent [FEVER Shared Task](http://fever.ai/task.html) (priliminary results, final results may change though).

The objective of the task is to build a system to verify information using evidences from Wikipedia. Given a claim, the system should first find "evidences" (sentences in Wikipedia pages) related to the claim, then decide whether evidences support or refute the claim, or the information is not enough (see shared task page for more details). We are working on  system description, which give more details of our approach. Stay tuned!

<!-- Follow the [baseline system](https://github.com/sheffieldnlp/fever-baselines), we divide the task into three stages: document retrieval (given a claim, find related documents in Wikipedia), sentence retrieval (find evidences in related documents) and [natural language inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02312.pdf) (NLI, predicate `SUPPORTS`, `REFUTES` or `NOT ENOUGH INFO` by comparing claim and evidences). For document retrieval, we use a rule based system, mainly based on the title of Wikipedia page. Sentence retrieval and NLI are both neural models. -->
